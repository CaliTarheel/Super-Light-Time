"""Which Lite laws a newly created reviewed_v1 world selects in this fork.

This module is imported only by server.py (and the command line through it),
never by the engine. It is therefore outside the engine helper-source closure
that server.capture_auxiliary_sources hashes into every checkpoint, so editing
this table never changes a saved run's recorded helper hashes and never blocks
resume or branch. Keep it that way: do not import it from tectonics or any
engine module.

The selection applies only where a world is created (SimulationManager.start
and the new-world form defaults from GET /api/config), never on resume,
branch or migration. Those re-read a saved config whose missing keys keep the
engine's historical defaults (fixed_trench, disabled, enhanced rifting off).
Explicit choices in the request always win, and legacy or profile-less
requests are returned unchanged. The result is written explicitly into the
run's config.json, so the saved world never depends on this table again.
